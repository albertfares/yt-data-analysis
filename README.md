## Abstract :page_facing_up::
YouTube's recommendation algorithm is a closely guarded secret. We seek to circumvent this "black box" by mapping the social structure of the platform from the bottom up. Using a massive dataset including 8.6 billion comments, we construct a network where channels are connected solely by the users who comment on them.

This approach ignores standard metrics such as view counts in order to reveal organic communities formed by genuine human interactions. The result is a transparent recommendation engine that prioritizes users' active interests —what makes them react— rather than passive metadata that may result from a simple trend. By shifting the focus from static categories (simple views) to dynamic user behavior, we offer a new way to discover content based on where communities are actually active.

## Research Questions

- **User Level (Behavior):** Is there any tendency in user commenting behavior? Is it possible to construct a network based on it?
- **Channel Level (Structure):** What organic structures emerge when we connect channels based on human behavior (comments) rather than algorithms? Which metric could be used to design a meaningful network based on comments?
- **Application (Recommendation):** Can we build a transparent recommendation engine based on comments that bypasses the "Rich-Get-Richer" cycle? Can we predict a user's next favorite channel simply by knowing who their "digital neighbors" are?


## Dataset :books::
Considering the size of YouNiverse, we chose not to explore another dataset.

For detailed documentation and methodology, see the original YouNiverse paper: 
[YouNiverse: Large-Scale Channel and Video Metadata from English-Speaking YouTube](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10378)

The dataset is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4650046).


## Methods

We focused on the large-scale structure of the YouNiverse dataset, employing the following methods:
- **Louvain Community Detection** (for identifying organic clusters)
- **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)** (for edge weighting)
- **PageRank & Betweenness Centrality** (for identifying Hubs and Bridges)
- **Interactive Visualization** (Chord Diagrams, Sankey Diagrams)

### 1. Preprocessing & User Profiling (The Signal)
To build a robust graph, we defined the "Signal" by filtering for **"Super Users"** ($U_{super}$). A user $u$ is retained only if they satisfy the following engagement thresholds:

$$u \in U_{super} \iff (N_{videos}(u) \ge 24) \land (N_{likes}(u) \ge 5)$$

Where:
* $N_{videos}(u)$: The number of unique videos user $u$ commented on (ensuring consistency).
* $N_{likes}(u)$: The total likes received on their comments (ensuring social validation).
* **Bot Removal:** We strictly removed the top $1\%$ of most active accounts to eliminate non-human behavior.

### 2. Network Construction (The Map)
We aggregated billions of interactions into a graph where nodes $i$ and $j$ represent Channels (aggregated by category).

* **The Interaction Score ($W_{ij}$):**
    We developed a custom edge weight that balances **specificity** (PMI) with **volume** (raw shared count). The weight $W_{ij}$ between two channels is defined as:

    $$W_{ij} = \text{PMI}(i, j) \times \log(|U_i \cap U_j|)$$

    Where the **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)** is calculated as:

    $$\text{PMI}(i, j) = \log\left(\frac{P(i, j)}{P(i)P(j)}\right) = \log\left(\frac{N \cdot |U_i \cap U_j|}{|U_i| \cdot |U_j|}\right)$$

    * $|U_i \cap U_j|$: Number of shared commentators between channel $i$ and $j$.
    * $N$: Total number of users in the network.
    * **Logic:** PMI penalizes generic links between massive channels, while the $\log$ term prevents statistically high PMI values from insignificant niche channels (e.g., 2 users sharing 2 channels) from dominating the graph.

* **Topology Analysis:**
    * We applied the **Louvain Algorithm** to maximize the modularity $Q$, partitioning the network into communities $C_1, ..., C_k$ where internal density is maximized.
    * We calculated **Degree** to identify Hubs and **Betweenness Centrality** ($C_B$) to identify Bridges.

### 3. The Recommendation Engine (The Tool)
Finally, we operationalized the network structure.
- **Proximity-Based Logic:** We built a tool that suggests channels based on **network proximity**. By locating a user within a specific behavioral cluster, the engine recommends the strongest neighboring nodes ("digital neighbors") that they haven't visited yet.
- **Value over Views:** This topology-based approach prioritizes **Appreciation** (strong social links $W_{ij}$) over raw **Views**, effectively bypassing the "Rich-Get-Richer" loop of traditional algorithms.
