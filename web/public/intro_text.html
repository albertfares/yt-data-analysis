    <h1>Unveiling the Hidden Web of YouTube</h1>

    <p>YouTube is often viewed as a library of isolated videos or a leaderboard of popular channels. But the real story isn't about the content creators, it's about the <strong>audience</strong>.</p>

    <p>What if we could map the "footprints" users leave behind? By analyzing the commenting behavior of millions of users, we reconstructed the hidden social structures that connect different corners of YouTube. We moved beyond simple view counts to answer a deeper question: <strong>Who hangs out with whom?</strong></p>

    <p>We built a <strong>Community Network</strong>, where connections are defined not by algorithms or official categories, but by the shared presence of active, human commenters.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Finding the "Real" Voices (Data Filtering)</h2>
    <p>Before mapping the network, we had to separate the signal from the noise. YouTube comments are notoriously filled with spam, bots, and "drive-by" remarks. To ensure our network represented genuine human interest, we applied a rigorous "High-Fidelity" filter:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Video Quality:</strong> We only considered "high interaction" videos with at least <strong>200 unique authors</strong>, ensuring the video sparked a real community discussion.</li>
        <li><strong>Author Consistency:</strong> We filtered for users who commented on at least <strong>24 different videos</strong> (averaging one per month over two years).</li>
        <li><strong>Social Validation:</strong> To filter out trolls or irrelevant noise, we required authors to have received at least <strong>5 likes</strong> on their comments, ensuring their contributions were acknowledged by others.</li>
        <li><strong>Bot Removal:</strong> We explicitly removed the top <strong>1% of most active accounts</strong> to strip out automated bots and spam scripts.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>The Result:</strong> A dataset of "Super Users": comments by people who are consistently active, socially validated, and genuinely engaged. 
    </blockquote>
    <strong>!!! ADD STATS ABOUT 2.5B COMMENTS !!!</strong>

    <h2>Defining the Network (Aggregation)</h2>
    <p>Analyzing individual videos is too granular: a single channel might upload thousands of videos, making the dataset too huge to process effectively. To understand broader trends, we zoomed out.</p>

    <p>We aggregated videos into <strong>Groups</strong> defined by the intersection of their <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Channel Name</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Instead of the Video ID:</em> "TfUHhwHJg60"</li>
        <li><em>We see:</em> "<code>Politics | NBC News</code>" or "<code>Entertainment | PewDiePie</code>"".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These Groups became the <strong>Nodes</strong> of our network.</p>
<strong>!!! ADD STATS ABOUT GROUPS !!!</strong>

<h2>The Mathematics of Connection</h2>
    <p>How do we know if two groups are actually connected? It isn't enough for them to just share a few users by random chance. We needed a metric that rewards <strong>strong, statistically significant overlap</strong>.</p>

    <p>We constructed the edges of our network based on the overlap of unique authors. The strength of the connection (the <strong>Edge Weight</strong>) was calculated using a custom scoring formula combining <strong>Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)</strong> and logarithmic scaling:</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
        $$ \text{Score}(i, j) = \text{PMI}(i, j) \times \log_{10}(|i \cap j|) $$
    </div>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(\text{PMI}(i, j) = \log \left( \frac{N \cdot |i \cap j|}{|i| \cdot |j|} \right)\) measures how much the groups overlap compared to random chance.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why use this?</strong> Without this normalization, the network would be dominated by massive channels (like generic Music or Gaming giants) simply because they have millions of commenters. They would appear at the center of everything just by sheer volume. PMI "penalizes" this generic popularity, highlighting only connections where the specific overlap is <em>significantly higher</em> than what we would expect from their size alone.
        </li>
        <li>
            \(\log_{10}(|i \cap j|)\) boosts the score based on the raw volume of shared authors, ensuring that tiny but "tight" communities don't overpower massive ones.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To ensure quality, we pruned the network to keep only the strongest connections, requiring a PMI \(\ge 1\) (above the median) and at least 3 shared authors (top 75%).</p>
   
    <h2>Visualizing the Ecosystem</h2>

    <h3>The Strength of Ties: Connection Distribution</h3>
    <p>Not all communities connect with the same intensity. Some topics form tight, insular clusters (high scores), while others have loose, casual overlaps. We analyzed the distribution of our custom <strong>Edge Weight (Score)</strong> across different video categories.</p>
    
    <p>At first we only consider the 'Category' part of the groups to get an overview of our network</p>
    <p>The "Violin Plot" below reveals the density of these connection strengths. A wider section indicates that many connections share that specific score.</p>

    <div class="user-guide">
        <strong>💡 User Guide:</strong> 
        Hover over the colored shapes to see detailed statistics for each category, including the <strong>Median Score</strong>, <strong>Quartiles</strong>, and <strong>Min/Max</strong> values.
        Compare the "fatness" of the violins: a shape that is wide at the top indicates a category with many strong, high-value connections.

    <h3>The Backbone: The "Best Friend" Network</h3>
    <p>Then, we strip away the complexity to reveal the underlying skeleton of the platform. In the network graph below, we applied a strict "Best Friend" filter: for every Category, we visualized <strong>only the single strongest connection</strong>:the one other category it shares the most users with.</p>
    
    <p>This approach eliminates the weak connections and highlights the <strong>primary pathways</strong> of the ecosystem. It reveals that the 'Entertainment' categorie act as a "hub" that connects all the others.</p>
    
    <!-- <div class="user-guide">
        <strong>💡 User Guide:</strong> 
        <strong>Nodes (Circles):</strong> Represent Categories. The size indicates the total number of unique commentators.
        <strong>Edges (Lines):</strong> Connect a category to its strongest partner. The thickness represents the volume of shared users.
        <strong>Interact:</strong> You can <strong>drag</strong> the nodes to rearrange the network, and <strong>scroll</strong> to zoom in/out.

    <h3>The Circle of Influence: Audience Overlap</h3>
    <p>The next step is to visualize the <strong>mutual magnitude</strong> of these connections using a Chord Diagram. This circular layout emphasizes the <em>reciprocal strength</em> between communities. The width of each chord is directly proportional to the number of shared commenters between two categories.</p>
    
    <!-- <p>The data reveals massive "Super-Connectors." For example, <strong>Comedy</strong> acts as a universal bridge, sharing over <strong>25 million</strong> distinct commentators with <em>Entertainment</em> and nearly <strong>20 million</strong> with <em>Gaming</em>. This suggests that humor is not just a category, but a fundamental layer that permeates the entire YouTube ecosystem.</p> -->

    <div class="user-guide">
        <strong>💡 User Guide:</strong> 
        <strong>Hover</strong> over any chord (the ribbons connecting the circle) to see the exact number of shared commentators between those two categories.
        <strong>Click</strong> on a colored category arc on the outer ring to "dim" the rest of the chart and highlight <em>only</em> that category's connections.

    <h3>The Landscape: Categories & Channels</h3>
    <p>Before analyzing the invisible connections, we must understand the nodes themselves. As stated above, we aggregated our data into groups defined by Category and Channel. The visualization below breaks down the composition of our dataset, showing the proportion of 'within' and 'cross' category connections.</p>

    <h3>The Hidden Tribes: Algorithmic Communities</h3>
    <p>Official YouTube categories (like "Gaming" or "Music") are useful labels, but do they reflect how people actually behave? To find out, we ignored the official labels and let the data speak for itself.</p>
    
    <p>We applied the <strong>Louvain Community Detection Algorithm</strong> to our network. This algorithm identifies "clusters" of groups that are tightly knit together, meaning users within these groups comment on each other's content far more frequently than they comment outside the group. These are the organic "neighborhoods" or "echo chambers" of YouTube.</p>
    
    <div class="formula-box" style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.95em;">
        <strong>How it works (The Louvain Method):</strong><br>
        Imagine coloring every node in the graph a different color. The algorithm iteratively changes the color of a node to match its neighbors <em>if and only if</em> doing so increases the "density" of connections within that color group. It repeats this until the network settles into stable communities where internal connections are maximized and external connections are minimized.
    <div style="background: #282c34; color: #abb2bf; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; margin: 15px 0; font-family: 'Consolas', 'Monaco', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4; border-left: 4px solid #61afef;">
            <pre style="margin: 0;">
# 1. Initialization: Every node is its own community
for node in graph:
    community[node] = unique_id()

# 2. Optimization: Move nodes to boost "Modularity"
while improvement_possible:
    for node in graph:
        best_community = find_best_neighbor_community(node)
        
        # If joining neighbor's group makes the network "tighter":
        if modularity_gain > 0:
            move_node(node, best_community)

# 3. Aggregation: Fuse communities into super-nodes and repeat</pre>
        </div>

        It repeats this process until the network settles into stable communities where internal connections are maximized and external connections are minimized.

    <p>The tool below allows you to inspect these mathematical tribes individually. By selecting a community, you can isolate specific subcultures to see which channels form their core.</p>

        <strong>💡 User Guide:</strong> 
        <strong>Select a Community:</strong> Use the selector (Community 1–15) to isolate a specific tribe.
        <strong>Analyze the Mix:</strong> Look at the channels in the selected community. Are they all "Gaming"? Or is it a mix of "Politics" and "News"?
        <strong>Spot the Hubs:</strong> Identify the central nodes that hold this specific community together.

    <h3>Mapping the Pathways: Category Flows</h3>
    <p>While the previous charts showed us <em>composition</em> and <em>intensity</em>, the <strong>Sankey Diagram</strong> maps the actual flow of audience members. It answers the question: </p>
    <p><em>"If a user comments on a specific channel, where else are they likely to comment? And what other channels are they likely to engage with for each category?"</em></p>
    
    <p>The width of the ribbons represents the score bridging two groups (calculated above). This reveals the "highways" of the YouTube ecosystem: the major routes that users travel between different topics.</p>

    <h2>The Link Between Success and Connectivity</h2>

    <h3>A Bit of Machine Learning: OLS Analysis</h3>
    <p>Does having millions of subscribers guarantee a loyal, active community? You might expect a straight line: more viewers = more interaction. But our analysis of over <strong>45,000 YouTube channels</strong> reveals a different reality.</p>

    <p>We ran an <strong>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</strong> regression on <strong>log-transformed data</strong> to predict a channel's Interaction Score (accumulated groups scores on channels) based on its subscriber count. This approach allows us to compare massive channels like PewDiePie with niche creators on a fair scale.</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
        $$ \log(\text{Interaction}) = 0.17 \times \log(\text{Subscribers}) + 2.30 $$
        R-squared = 0.045
    </div>

    <p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drastic Diminishing Returns:</strong> Because this is a log-log model, the coefficient (0.17) represents <em>elasticity</em>. It implies that a <strong>100% increase</strong> in subscribers (doubling your channel size) yields only a <strong>~12.5% increase</strong> in community connectivity. Engagement does not scale linearly with fame; it trails far behind.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Cult Classic" Effect:</strong> The incredibly low <strong>R-squared (0.045)</strong> tells us that subscriber count explains only <strong>4.5%</strong> of the variance in interaction. The other 95.5% is driven by hidden factors: likely content quality, niche appeal, or personality.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="formula-box" style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.9em; background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #3498db;">
        <strong>🧮 How we calculated the 12.5%:</strong><br>
        In a Log-Log model \((\log(Y) = \beta \cdot \log(X))\), the relationship follows a Power Law \((Y = X^\beta)\).
        <br>
        If we double the subscribers \((X \rightarrow 2X)\), the new interaction score is:
        $$ (2X)^{0.17} = 2^{0.17} \times X^{0.17} $$
        Since \( 2^{0.17} \approx 1.125 \), the score increases by a factor of <strong>1.125</strong>, or <strong>+12.5%</strong>.
    </div>

    <p>The scatter plot below visualizes this divergence. The <strong>Blue points</strong> represent "Cult Classics": channels that punch way above their weight, generating massive community interaction despite having fewer subscribers. The <strong>Red points</strong> indicate "Sleeping Giants": massive channels with comparatively passive audiences.</p>
