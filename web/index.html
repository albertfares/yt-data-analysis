  <h1>The Algorithm Knows You... Or Does It?</h1>

  <p>
    Does it feel like you are always watching the same five channels?
    Do you feel trapped in a feedback loop where the "Rich-Get-Richer"
    and the famous just get more famous?
  </p>

  <p>
    YouTube's recommendation algorithm is a "black box" that prioritizes
    clicks over connection, often hiding the most vibrant communities from view.
  </p>

  <p><strong>But what if we could redraw the map?</strong></p>

  <p>
    We believe that the true geography of YouTube isn't defined by metadata
    or view counts, but by <strong>you</strong> — the users.
  </p>

  <h2>Rebuilding YouTube from the Bottom Up</h2>

  <p>
    To bypass the traditional recommendation system, we mapped YouTube
    from the bottom up by focusing on real human behavior.
    We profiled consistent, socially validated users and tracked how
    they migrate between channels.
  </p>

  <p>
    By analyzing <strong>8.6 billion comments</strong>,
    we built a community network where channels are connected
    solely by shared commenters.

    <h2>Our Research Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User Behavior:</strong>
        Is commenting structured enough to build a meaningful network?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Organic Structure:</strong>
        What structures emerge when we connect channels through people,
        not algorithms?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recommendation:</strong>
        Can we build a transparent recommendation engine
        based on human interaction?
      </li>
    </ul>
