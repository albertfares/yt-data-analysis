    <h1>Unveiling the Hidden Web of YouTube</h1>

    <p>YouTube is often viewed as a library of isolated videos or a leaderboard of popular channels. But the real story isn't about the content creators, it's about the <strong>audience</strong>.</p>

    <p>What if we could map the "footprints" users leave behind? By analyzing the commenting behavior of millions of users, we reconstructed the hidden social structures that connect different corners of YouTube. We moved beyond simple view counts to answer a deeper question: <strong>Who hangs out with whom?</strong></p>

    <p>We built a <strong>Community Network</strong>, where connections are defined not by algorithms or official categories, but by the shared presence of active, human commenters.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Finding the "Real" Voices (Data Filtering)</h2>
    <p>Before mapping the network, we had to separate the signal from the noise. YouTube comments are notoriously filled with spam, bots, and "drive-by" remarks. To ensure our network represented genuine human interest, we applied a rigorous "High-Fidelity" filter:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Video Quality:</strong> We only considered "high interaction" videos with at least <strong>200 unique authors</strong>, ensuring the video sparked a real community discussion.</li>
        <li><strong>Author Consistency:</strong> We filtered for users who commented on at least <strong>24 different videos</strong> (averaging one per month over two years).</li>
        <li><strong>Social Validation:</strong> To filter out trolls or irrelevant noise, we required authors to have received at least <strong>5 likes</strong> on their comments, ensuring their contributions were acknowledged by others.</li>
        <li><strong>Bot Removal:</strong> We explicitly removed the top <strong>1% of most active accounts</strong> to strip out automated bots and spam scripts.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>The Result:</strong> A dataset of "Super Users": comments by people who are consistently active, socially validated, and genuinely engaged. 
    </blockquote>
    <strong>!!! ADD STATS ABOUT 2.5B COMMENTS !!!</strong>

    <h2>Defining the Network (Aggregation)</h2>
    <p>Analyzing individual videos is too granular: a single channel might upload thousands of videos, making the dataset too huge to process effectively. To understand broader trends, we zoomed out.</p>

    <p>We aggregated videos into <strong>Groups</strong> defined by the intersection of their <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Channel Name</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Instead of the Video ID:</em> "TfUHhwHJg60"</li>
        <li><em>We see:</em> "<code>Politics | NBC News</code>" or "<code>Entertainment | PewDiePie</code>"".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These Groups became the <strong>Nodes</strong> of our network.</p>
<strong>!!! ADD STATS ABOUT GROUPS !!!</strong>

<h2>The Mathematics of Connection</h2>
    <p>How do we know if two groups are actually connected? It isn't enough for them to just share a few users by random chance. We needed a metric that rewards <strong>strong, statistically significant overlap</strong>.</p>

    <p>We constructed the edges of our network based on the overlap of unique authors. The strength of the connection (the <strong>Edge Weight</strong>) was calculated using a custom scoring formula combining <strong>Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)</strong> and logarithmic scaling:</p>

    <div class="formula-box">
        $$ \text{Score}(i, j) = \text{PMI}(i, j) \times \log_{10}(|i \cap j|) $$
    </div>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(\text{PMI}(i, j) = \log \left( \frac{N \cdot |i \cap j|}{|i| \cdot |j|} \right)\) measures how much the groups overlap compared to random chance.
            <br>
            <em>(Here, \(|i|\) is the size of group \(i\), \(|i \cap j|\) is the number of shared authors, and \(N\) is the total universe of authors).</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            \(\log_{10}(|i \cap j|)\) boosts the score based on the raw volume of shared authors, ensuring that tiny but "tight" communities don't overpower massive ones.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To ensure quality, we pruned the network to keep only the strongest connections, requiring a PMI \(\ge 1\) (above the median) and at least 3 shared authors (top 75%).</p>
    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>With this network constructed, we can now explore the shape of the YouTube universe. In the following sections, we will explore:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Network Visualizations:</strong> A deep dive into general group distributions and connectivity degrees.</li>
        <li><strong>The Recommender:</strong> A tool that suggests new content categories based on your viewing habits.</li>
        <li><strong>Popularity vs. Connectivity:</strong> An analysis comparing the most "connected" nodes to traditional metrics like views and subscribers.</li>
    </ol>
