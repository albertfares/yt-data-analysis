  <h1>The Algorithm Knows You... Or Does It?</h1>

  <p>
    Does it feel like you are always watching the same five channels?
    Do you feel trapped in a feedback loop where the "Rich-Get-Richer"
    and the famous just get more famous?
  </p>

  <p>
    YouTube's recommendation algorithm is a "black box" that prioritizes
    clicks over connection, often hiding the most vibrant communities from view.
  </p>

  <p><strong>But what if we could redraw the map?</strong></p>

  <p>
    We believe that the true geography of YouTube isn't defined by metadata
    or view counts, but by <strong>you</strong> — the users.
  </p>

  <h2>Rebuilding YouTube from the Bottom Up</h2>

  <p>
    To bypass the traditional recommendation system, we mapped YouTube
    from the bottom up by focusing on real human behavior.
    We profiled consistent, socially validated users and tracked how
    they migrate between channels.
  </p>

  <p>
    By analyzing <strong>8.6 billion comments</strong>,
    we built a community network where channels are connected
    solely by shared commenters.
  </p>

  <div class="research-box">
    <h2>Our Research Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User Behavior:</strong>
        Is commenting structured enough to build a meaningful network?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Organic Structure:</strong>
        What structures emerge when we connect channels through people,
        not algorithms?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recommendation:</strong>
        Can we build a transparent recommendation engine
        based on human interaction?
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Two Ways to Explore the Data</h2>

<p>
  To answer these questions, we didn’t follow a single path.
  Instead, we discovered that <strong>two complementary journeys</strong>
  emerge from the same dataset.
</p>

<p>
  Both journeys begin with the same foundation — <strong>8.6 billion comments</strong>
  and millions of engaged users — but they tell two very different stories
  about how YouTube actually works.
</p>

<div class="research-box">
  <p style="margin-top: 0;">
    <strong>So… where do you want to start?</strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The Network Journey</strong><br />
      In this path, <em>we</em> guide you.
      We begin by carefully cleaning and validating billions of comments
      to isolate genuine human engagement.
      From there, we connect channels through shared audiences,
      revealing the large-scale structure of YouTube —
      its hubs, bridges, and hidden communities —
      as seen through an analyst’s lens.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The User Journey</strong><br />
      In this path, <em>you</em> take over.
      Instead of starting from predefined labels,
      you step back and decide how behavior itself should be compared.
      By grouping users with identical commenting patterns,
      you explore recurring ways people actually interact with YouTube —
      discovering structure not because we point it out,
      but because <em>you observe it emerge</em>.

  </ul>
